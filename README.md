# CAD-Digital-Screens

Identified Issue

Staff at Headquarters are often unaware of incidents occurring throughout the state, particularly in real time, and as a result risk losing sight of the underlying reason behind their role at CFA.
This can lead to complacency about their tasks and the impact of same, disenchantment in their contribution to the overall organisational goals, and a feeling of being ‘siloed’ or not an integral part of the organisation as a whole.


Proposed Solution

Operational Communications proposes to resolve the aforementioned issue by creating a series of networked digital screens that will display information such as current weather information and warnings, total fire bans, national breaking news, and active incidents as relevant to the season, day, or region.
Operational Communications theorises that sharing appropriate real-time operational information with all staff will help to build an empathetic, inclusive, and proactive membership where all staff can be reminded of the importance of their contribution, while also delivering an effective advice and warning system to enhance staff personal safety levels.
